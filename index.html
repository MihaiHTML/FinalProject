      <h2 class="title">What is HTML?</h2>
      <p> HTML stands for hyper text markup language and is a computer language that is used to create websites. HTML is a collection of symbols and codes inserted into a text document that can be opened and displayed by a web browser. It can be created in any text editor, but there are countless programs specially designed for HTML. They offer a more detailed interface that assist in formatting and editing. It is relatively easy to learn, however mastering it is another story. </p>

      <h2 class="title">How HTML works.</h2>
      <p>HTML works by providing a web browser a series of codes that tells it how a webpage should be displayed. The code is created by using specific text inside of opening and closing angle brackets known as tags. All of the content on a webpage, such as images, text and links all go within a designated tag. For example, you are reading a paragraph which is text within a paragraph tag: &lt;p&gt; Text  &lt;/p&gt;. There are <strong>tags</strong> that control everything from formatting to appearance. There are a few tags that are neccesary for any page to work correctly. The HTML document can only be displayed by a web browser. If you try to open an HTML document without a web broswer you will only see the source code. </p>

      <h2 class="title">HTML Apperance</h2>
      <p>Another part of HTML is using the code to make an appealing source of content. There are multiple ways of changing the way that content is diplayed within an HTML document. One method is by linking a <strong>style sheet</strong> to your page. A style sheet is a seperate file type known as CSS or cascading style sheet. This is an external document that dictates how your website appears. It is common to add only content in an HTML file and all of the design properties inside the CSS document. The CSS is then linked to the HTML file using a special code. The benefit of using CSS is that you can link it to multiple pages. For example, if you wanted to have red font on your website, you do not have to put that code on each page. </p>
